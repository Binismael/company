## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth handles password hashing
- JWT tokens for API requests
- Session storage in browser
- Protected routes check authentication

### Authorization (RLS)
```
Users can only see:
- Their own profile (all roles)
- Data related to their role:
  - Students: Own results, attendance
  - Teachers: Their classes and related data
  - Admins: Everything
  - Parents: Their children's data
  - Bursars: Financial data
```

### API Protection
- All endpoints validate authorization header
- Admin endpoints check admin role
- Student/Teacher data is role-restricted

---

## 📝 Sample Data Setup

The SQL schema includes sample data:
- 3 sample classes (SS3 A, SS2 B, JSS1 C)
- 8 sample subjects (Math, English, Physics, etc.)
- 1 admin user (admin@elbethel.edu)

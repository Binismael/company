## üìä Database Setup

### 15 Tables Overview

| # | Table | Purpose | Rows |
|---|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | users | Authentication & roles | Variable |
| 2 | classes | Form classes (SS1-SS3, JSS1-JSS3) | 6-50 |
| 3 | subjects | School subjects | 12+ |
| 4 | class_subjects | Class-subject-teacher mapping | Many |
| 5 | students | Student profiles | Unlimited |
| 6 | attendance | Daily attendance records | Unlimited |
| 7 | results | Academic grades & scores | Unlimited |
| 8 | assignments | Teacher assignments | Unlimited |
| 9 | assignment_submissions | Student submissions | Unlimited |
| 10 | announcements | School announcements | Unlimited |
| 11 | notifications | User notifications | Unlimited |
| 12 | messages | Internal messaging | Unlimited |
| 13 | fees | Student fee records | Unlimited |
| 14 | payments | Payment transactions | Unlimited |
| 15 | exams | Exam scheduling | Unlimited |

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Create Tables in Supabase

```
1. Log in to Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy content from: lib/database-setup.sql
4. Paste and execute
5. Verify all 15 tables are created (see DATABASE_TABLES_CHECKLIST.md)
```

#### Step 2: Add Migration for Exams Table

```
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy content from: lib/supabase-migrations.sql
3. Execute migration
4. This adds:
   - exams table
   - Registration number system columns
   - Helper functions for auto-generation
```

#### Step 3: Verify Setup

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
  table_name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Should return 15 tables with various column counts.

## üîê Authentication System

### Login Methods

#### Method 1: Email/Password (Traditional)
```
Email: test@test.com
Password: Test123
```

#### Method 2: Registration Number/Password (New System)
```
Registration Number: ELBA/25/SS3A/001
Password: Test123
```

### Registration Number Format

**Format:** `SCHOOLCODE/YEAR/CLASSFORM/SEQUENCE`

**Examples:**
- `ELBA/25/SS3A/001` - First student in SS3 A class, 2025
- `ELBA/25/SS3B/002` - Second student in SS3 B class, 2025
- `ELBA/25/JSS1A/001` - First student in JSS1 A class, 2025

### Auto-Generation

When a student is created:
1. System checks class form level
2. Gets next sequence number for that class
3. Generates: `ELBA/[YEAR]/[CLASSFORM]/[SEQUENCE]`
4. Stores in `students.reg_number` field
5. Student can use this to login instead of email

### Implementation Files

- **Client Logic:** `app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- **Utilities:** `lib/registration-utils.ts`
- **Database Functions:** `lib/supabase-migrations.sql` (function: generate_student_reg_number)

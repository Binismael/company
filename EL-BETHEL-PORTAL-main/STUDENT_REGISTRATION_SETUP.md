---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Phase 1: Create Tables and Functions

**Step 1: Run SQL Migration**
```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of lib/student-registration-complete.sql
3. Execute the SQL
```

**Step 2: Verify Migration Success**
```sql
-- Check if students table has new columns
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'students';

-- Should see: first_name, last_name, phone, address, state, lga, 
--            guardian_relationship, photo_url, birth_certificate_url,
--            id_proof_url, previous_school, approved, approval_date,
--            rejection_reason

-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'auto_generate_admission_number';

-- Check if view exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.views WHERE table_name = 'pending_student_registrations';
```

### Phase 2: Create Storage Bucket

**Step 1: Create Bucket**
1. Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Click "New Bucket"
3. Name: `student-documents`
4. Choose: **Public** bucket (for easier access) or **Private** (more secure)
5. Click "Create Bucket"

**Step 2: Configure Bucket Policy** (Optional, for fine-grained control)
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload to their folder
CREATE POLICY "Allow user uploads" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'student-documents' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow admins to read all files
CREATE POLICY "Allow admins to read" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'student-documents' AND
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin')
  );
```

### Phase 3: Enable Row-Level Security (RLS)

Verify RLS is enabled on all tables:
```sql
-- Check RLS status
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('students', 'student_documents', 'student_approvals')
AND schemaname = 'public';

-- Should show: rowsecurity = true for all three tables
```

---

## üöÄ Application Setup

### Phase 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd EL-BETHEL-PORTAL-main
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Phase 2: Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check .env.local or environment
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Should output your Supabase credentials (non-empty)
```

### Phase 3: Test Application
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/register/student
# You should see the student registration form
```

---

## üìù Initial User Setup

### Create Admin Account

**Option A: Via Supabase Auth**
1. Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Click "Add user" / "Invite user"
3. Email: `admin@elbethel.edu`
4. Password: (set a secure password)
5. Click Create User

**Option B: Via Application**
1. Sign up as a new user
2. Register with email: `admin@elbethel.edu`
3. Update user role to `admin` via SQL:

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'admin@elbethel.edu';
```

### Create Test Student Account

1. Navigate to `/register/student`
2. Fill out the form with test data:
   - Email: `student@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123`
   - Name: Test Student
   - Fill all required fields
3. Click "Complete Registration"
4. You should see: "Registration successful! Your admission number is STD-YYMMDD-0001"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table 'students' doesn't exist"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run the migration SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy contents of lib/student-registration-complete.sql
# Execute in Supabase ‚Üí SQL Editor
```

### Issue: "Admission number not generating"
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'auto_generate_admission_number';

-- If not found, re-run the migration:
-- Execute lib/student-registration-complete.sql again
```

### Issue: "Storage bucket not found"
**Solution:**
```
1. Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Create new bucket: "student-documents"
3. Set to Public bucket
```

### Issue: "RLS policy blocking inserts"
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check which policy is blocking:
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'students';

-- Temporarily disable RLS for testing:
ALTER TABLE students DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Re-enable after testing:
ALTER TABLE students ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Issue: "File upload returns 403 Forbidden"
**Solution:**
1. Check bucket is Public
2. Verify bucket name is `student-documents`
3. Check CORS settings in Supabase Storage

### Issue: "Environment variables not loading"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if .env.local exists
ls -la .env.local

# Or check DevServerControl environment
# The system should have set these automatically

# Verify in browser console (Next.js will show errors)
```

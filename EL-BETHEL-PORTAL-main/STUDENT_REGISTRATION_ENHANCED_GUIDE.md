## üìà Database Verification

Run these queries to verify setup:

```sql
-- Count subjects by class level
SELECT class_level, COUNT(*) FROM public.subjects GROUP BY class_level;

-- Count subjects by department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM public.subjects GROUP BY department;

-- List subjects for a class/department/term
SELECT name, code FROM public.subjects 
WHERE class_level = 'SSS1' AND department = 'Science' AND term = '1st Term';

-- Check students with admission numbers
SELECT admission_number, class_level, department FROM public.students LIMIT 5;
```

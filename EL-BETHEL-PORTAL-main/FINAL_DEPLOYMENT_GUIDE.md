## üìã Pre-Deployment Verification (5 minutes)

### Check 1: Verify All Files Exist

```bash
# In your project root, verify these files exist:
‚úÖ app/register/student/page.tsx
‚úÖ app/admin/registrations/page.tsx
‚úÖ lib/student-registration-service.ts
‚úÖ lib/student-approval-utils.ts

‚úÖ FINAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
```

### Check 2: Verify Environment Variables

```bash
# These should be set in your environment:
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Both should return non-empty values
# If empty, check .env.local or DevServerControl settings
```

### Check 3: Verify App is Running

## ‚ö° Quick Troubleshooting During Launch

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "students table doesn't exist" | Re-run SQL migration from lib/student-registration-complete.sql |
| Admission number is NULL | Ensure trigger was created (check SQL execution logs) |
| File upload fails | Verify bucket exists and is Public in Supabase Storage |
| Admin can't see students | Check user role = 'admin' in database |
| RLS blocks operations | Review RLS policies, may need to adjust based on your auth setup |
| Form won't load | Check browser console for errors, verify environment variables |
| Database won't connect | Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY |

## 🗄️ Database Setup Required (BEFORE USING)

### Critical: Execute These SQL Migrations

**In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor, copy and execute:**

```sql
-- ENTIRE CONTENTS OF: lib/student-registration-complete.sql
```

**This creates:**
- [x] Enhanced `students` table columns
  - first_name, last_name, phone, address, state, lga
  - guardian_relationship, photo_url, birth_certificate_url, id_proof_url
  - previous_school, approved, approval_date, rejection_reason

- [x] `student_documents` table
- [x] `student_approvals` table
- [x] Auto-admission number trigger
- [x] Approval workflow functions (RPC)
- [x] Admin dashboard view
- [x] RLS policies for all tables

### Critical: Create Storage Bucket

**In Supabase Dashboard → Storage:**
1. Click "New Bucket"
2. Name: `student-documents`
3. Select: **Public** (for easy access) or **Private** (more secure)
4. Create Bucket

---

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Path

### Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)
```
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy lib/student-registration-complete.sql
4. Execute in SQL Editor
5. ✅ Verify: Check for students table columns, triggers, views
```

### Step 2: Storage Setup (2 minutes)
```
1. Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create Bucket → Name: "student-documents"
3. Set visibility to Public
4. ✅ Verify: Bucket appears in storage list
```

### Step 3: Verify App (5 minutes)
```
1. npm run dev
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/register/student
3. ✅ Verify: Form loads with all 6 steps
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/registrations
5. ✅ Verify: Admin dashboard loads
```

### Step 4: Test End-to-End (10 minutes)
```
1. Fill registration form with test data
2. ✅ Verify: Success message with admission number (STD-YYMMDD-####)
3. Check database: Student record created
4. ✅ Verify: Admission number auto-generated
5. Check Supabase Storage: Files uploaded (if any)
6. Admin panel should show pending student
7. Click Approve → ✅ Verify: Status changes to approved
```

**Total Time: ~25 minutes to fully operational** ⏱️

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Table doesn't exist"
**Solution:**
```
1. Open Supabase → SQL Editor
2. Copy lib/student-registration-complete.sql
3. Execute the SQL
4. Wait for completion
5. Refresh page
```

### Issue: "Admission number always null"
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check trigger
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'auto_generate_admission_number';

-- If not found, re-run migration

-- Test manually
INSERT INTO students (user_id, first_name, last_name) 
VALUES ('test-id', 'Test', 'User')
RETURNING admission_number;

-- Should return: STD-YYMMDD-0001
```

### Issue: "File upload fails with 403"
**Solution:**
1. Check bucket is Public in Supabase Storage
2. Verify bucket name is exactly `student-documents`
3. Check CORS settings (should be auto-configured)

### Issue: "RLS blocking student inserts"
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Temporarily test without RLS:
ALTER TABLE students DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Try registration

-- Re-enable after testing:
ALTER TABLE students ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Issue: "Admin can't see students"
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify admin role
SELECT role FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@email.com';

-- Should show: admin

-- If not, update it:
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@email.com';
```
